## ðŸ§ª Personal Projects

In my own time, Iâ€™ve explored projects that combine finance, data science, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy experimenting with predictive models, analyzing real-world datasets, and designing simple tools or concepts that address everyday challenges. These projects have helped me deepen my technical skills and think more critically about how to turn ideas into impact.
