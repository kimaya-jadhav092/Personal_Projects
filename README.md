## ðŸ§ª Personal Projects

In my own time, Iâ€™ve explored projects that combine finance, data science, and creative problem-solving. I enjoy experimenting with predictive models, analyzing real-world datasets, and designing simple tools/concepts that address everyday problems. These projects have helped me deepen my technical skills and think more critically.
